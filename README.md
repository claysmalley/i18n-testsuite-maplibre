# i18n-testsuite-maplibre
A set of labels in languages that MapLibre GL JS cannot render.

The file `tests.geojson` has a few cities in India and South-East Asian contries with the English name stored in the `name` property and a native name stored in the `native_name` property.

MapLibre GL JS can currently (v3.3.1) not render any of the `native_name`s.

To show the expected label, we add a canvas-generated image with a white background below MapLibre labels.

Unicode defines a list of scripts which require text shaping, see https://cldr.unicode.org/development/updating-codes/updating-script-metadata.

I took the list of script which require text shaping, and gave it to ChatGPT with the task "give me a city with geolocation for each of the following scripts...". Since these tests are generated by a language model, it is not certain that they are correct...
